Customer Report
===============================================================================
Purpose:
	- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviour

Highlights:
	1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
	2. Segments customers into categories (vip, Regular, New) and age groups.
	3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total sales
		- total quantity purchased
		- lifespan (in months)
	4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
		- recency (months since last order)
		- average order values
		- average monthly spend
