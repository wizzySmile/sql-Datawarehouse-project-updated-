## Project Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems.
- Support structured data ingestion from ERP and CRM source files.
- Enable historical and analytical reporting through a curated Gold layer.
- Provide business-level reporting and KPI visibility using Tableau dashboards.
- Perform advanced customer analytics using Python to analyze customer behavior, engagement, and value.
- Support customer segmentation, churn inference, and revenue prioritization.

### Data Requirements

- Source data must be available in structured CSV format from ERP and CRM systems.
- Data must include customer, product, and sales transaction information.
- Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats must be resolved before analysis.
- The Gold layer must expose business-ready fact and dimension tables suitable for analytics.

---

### Technical Requirements

- SQL Server for data warehousing, transformations, and analytical views.
- Python for advanced analytics, including RFM analysis, CLV estimation, churn analysis, and visualizations.
- Tableau for business intelligence dashboards and high-level reporting.
- Jupyter Notebook environment for Python-based analysis.
- Draw.io for data architecture, data flow, and data model documentation.
- GitHub for version control and project documentation.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

- The data warehouse design should follow a scalable architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
- SQL scripts should be modular, readable, and reusable.
- Analytics outputs should be interpretable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Visualizations should clearly communicate insights and support decision-making.
- Documentation should clearly explain data models, analytics logic, and project structure.

---

### Assumptions and Constraints

- The analysis focuses on the available historical dataset; real-time data processing is out of scope.
- Churn is inferred using behavioral engagement signals due to the absence of an explicit churn label.
- Customer Lifetime Value is estimated using historical transaction data and does not guarantee future performance.
